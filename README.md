# 📘 DSA Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems.  
I solve problems regularly from platforms like **LeetCode, CodeStudio, GFG, CodeChef, HackerRank**, and more.  
Each solution is written with clean code, comments, and optimized approaches wherever possible.
